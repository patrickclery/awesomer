A curated list of awesome Common Lisp learning resources

## Online Books

- [Common Lisp Koans](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans) - Not exactly a book, but a set of koans to help you learn the language.
- [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming by Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp) - Has many interesting applications of Lisp, but is no longer a good reference for AI.
