# awesome-computational-geometry

A curated list of awesome computational geometry visualizations, frameworks, and resources 

## Libraries

- [Computational Geometry Unity Library](https://github.com/Habrador/Computational-geometry) - A library of computational geometry algorithms for Unity.
- [geometry3Sharp](https://github.com/gradientspace/geometry3Sharp) - Open-Source, Boost-licensed C# library for geometric computing.
- [hull.js](https://github.com/AndriiHeonia/hull) - JavaScript library that builds the convex hull of a set of points.
- [S2 Geometry Library](https://github.com/google/s2geometry) - A package for manipulating geometric shapes. Unlike many geometry libraries, S2 is primarily designed to work with spherical geometry, i.e., shapes drawn on a sphere rather than on a planar 2D map. This makes it especially suitable for working with geographic data.
