Curated list of references for development of DOS applications.

## Source code

- [Catacomb](https://github.com/CatacombGames/Catacomb) - 2D top-down shooter developed by Softdisk (later becoming id Software). Supports EGA and CGA graphics. Written in Turbo Pascal and assembly.
- [Catacomb 3D](https://github.com/CatacombGames/Catacomb3D) - First-person shooter in fantasy setting developed by Softdisk (later becoming id Software). Features pseudo-3D graphics with raycasting technique. Supports EGA graphics. Written in C and assembly. Compiled with Borland C++ 3.1.
- [Commander Keen in Keen Dreams](https://github.com/keendreams/keen) - Side-scrolling platform game developed by id Software. Keen Dreams is the Commander Keen game created between Keen 3 and Keen 4 (often considered "Keen 3.5"), but was not widely released. Written in C and assembly.
- [Descent](https://github.com/videogamepreservation/descent) - First sci-fi FPS/space shooter to feature entirely true 3D graphics. Written in C and assembly.
- [Descent II](https://github.com/videogamepreservation/descent2) - Sequel to Descent. Written in C and assembly.
- [DIGPAK sound drivers source code](https://github.com/jratcliff63367/digpak) - Original source code for the DIGPAK sound drivers uploaded to GitHub by John W. Ratcliff. List of all homebrew DOS games: http://www.doshaven.eu
- [Doom](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM) - Sci-fi FPS developed by id Software where you fight demons from hell on Mars. The DOS-specific code for Doom could not be published because of a dependency to the licensed DMX sound library, hence why it's cleaned up and only the Linux source is there. However, the Heretic and Hexen projects contain the original DOS code in a way where DMX-related code is removed.
- [DOS Defender](https://github.com/skeeto/dosdefender-ld31) - Christopher Wellons's x86 real mode DOS Asteroids clone created as an entry for Lundum Dare #31.
- [DOS-VGA-Game](https://github.com/marcomarrero/DOS-VGA-Game) - Marco A. Marrero's DOS VGA/hardware library implemented in assembly and Turbo Pascal.
- [Dungeons of Noudar](https://github.com/TheFakeMontyOnTheRun/dungeons-of-noudar) - First-person 2.5D dungeon-crawler on protected mode. Written in C++, includes software rendering, fixed point math, test coverage and sound (PC speaker, Adlib, OPL2LPT).
- [Floppy Bird](https://github.com/icebreaker/floppybird) - Flappy Bird clone written in 16 bit assembly. Not a DOS program, but a PC-Booter application instead (although it's also possible to build a COM executable for DOS).
