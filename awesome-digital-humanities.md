## Tool Building and Rapid Prototyping

- [JupyterHub Workspace](https://github.com/maltevogl/jupyterworkspace) - The JupyterHub Workspace aims to be a collaborative programming and code-sharing platform. It provides access to browser-based Jupyter Notebooks, which integrate code with explanatory text, and are already used as a new publishing form. Data can be shared using the Nextcloud backend. A single sign-on mechanism simplifies access. By sharing useful code snippets among users, a growing examples collection further lowers the entrance barrier to programming for new DH members.
