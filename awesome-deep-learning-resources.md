# awesome-deep-learning-resources

Rough list of my favorite deep learning resources, useful for revisiting topics or for reference. I have got through all of the content listed there, carefully. - Guillaume Chevalier

## Practical Resources

- [Neuraxle, a framwework for machine learning pipelines](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle) - The best framework for structuring and deploying your machine learning projects, and which is also compatible with most framework (e.g.: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and so forth).
- [TensorFlow's GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) - Most known deep learning framework, both high-level and low-level while staying flexible.
- [skflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/skflow) - TensorFlow wrapper Ã  la scikit-learn.
- [carpedm20/NTM-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/NTM-tensorflow) - Neural Turing Machine TensorFlow implementation.
- [LSTM for Human Activity Recognition (HAR)](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/LSTM-Human-Activity-Recognition) - Tutorial of mine on using LSTMs on time series for classification.
- [Deep stacked residual bidirectional LSTMs for HAR](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/HAR-stacked-residual-bidir-LSTMs) - Improvements on the previous project.
- [Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Time Series Prediction](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction) - Tutorial of mine on how to predict temporal sequences of numbers - that may be multichannel.
- [Hyperopt for a Keras CNN on CIFAR-100](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/Hyperopt-Keras-CNN-CIFAR-100) - Auto (meta) optimizing a neural net (and its architecture) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
- [Smoothly Blend Image Patches](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/Smoothly-Blend-Image-Patches) - Smooth patch merger for [semantic segmentation with a U-Net](https://vooban.com/en/tips-articles-geek-stuff/satellite-image-segmentation-workflow-with-u-net/).
- [Self Governing Neural Networks (SGNN): the Projection Layer](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/SGNN-Self-Governing-Neural-Networks-Projection-Layer) - With this, you can use words in your deep learning models without training nor loading embeddings.
- [Neuraxle](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle) - Neuraxle is a Machine Learning (ML) library for building neat pipelines, providing the right abstractions to both ease research, development, and deployment of your ML applications.
- [Clean Machine Learning, a Coding Kata](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Kata-Clean-Machine-Learning-From-Dirty-Code) - Learn the good design patterns to use for doing Machine Learning the good way, by practicing. <a name="some-datasets" /> Those are resources I have found that seems interesting to develop models onto.
- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) - An awesome list of public datasets.
