# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

  The application uses a `config/repos.yml` file to define which Awesome Lists to process. You should create this file by copying the example template:

  ```bash
  cp config/repos.example.yml config/repos.yml
  ```

  Then, edit `config/repos.yml` to specify the repositories you want to track.

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
