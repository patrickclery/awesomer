:pencil: A curated list of Web Performance Optimization. Everyone can contribute here!

## Benchmark - CSS

- [CSS-perf](https://github.com/mdo/css-perf) - Completely unscientific way of testing CSS performance. Most of these tests will revolve around methodologies and techniques for determining effective CSS architecture. Put another way, I want to know what works best given a particular comparison of CSS strategies.

## Minifiers - JS & CSS

- [Clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css) - A fast, efficient, and well-tested CSS minifier for node.js.

- [YUI Compressor](https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor) - JavaScript compressor which, in addition to removing comments and white-spaces, obfuscates local variables using the smallest possible variable name. This obfuscation is safe, even when using constructs such as 'eval' or 'with' (although the compression is not optimal is those cases) Compared to jsmin, the average savings is around 20%.
