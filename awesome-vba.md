# awesome-vba

A curated list of awesome VBA/VB6 frameworks, libraries, software and resources

## Resources

- [Planet Source Code](https://github.com/Planet-Source-Code/PSCIndex) - A code repository GitHub which holds copious amounts of code. The site was closed down in 2023, but fortunately all VBA/VB6 samples were archived on GitHub today. Possibly not the entire collection (?) of projects/source code that was previously available at the PSC website.
- [vbAccelerator Archive](https://github.com/tannerhelland/vbAccelerator-Archive) - Archived copy of vbAccelerator site (articles, source code, etc.) that disappeared in 2015, reappeared in 2018, and anyone's guess what's going to next&hellip; Primarily VB6, but useful VBA resource.
