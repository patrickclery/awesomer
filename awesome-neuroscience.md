## Programming

- [Nengo](https://github.com/nengo/nengo) - Library for creating and simulating large-scale brain models.
- [Nitime](https://github.com/nipy/nitime) - Timeseries analysis for neuroscience data.
- [Nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn) - Module for performing statistical learning/machine learning on NeuroImaging data.
- [DIPY](https://github.com/nipy/dipy) - Toolbox for analysis of MR diffusion imaging.
- [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) - Community-driven software for processing time-resolved neural signals including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).
- [NiBabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel) - Provides read and write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats.
- [PsychoPy](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy) - Package for running psychology and neuroscience experiments. It allows for creating psychology stimuli in Python.
- [NuPic](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) - Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing is an implementation of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a theory of intelligence based strictly on the neuroscience of the neocortex.
- [Brian2](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2) - Free, open source simulator for spiking neural networks.
- [expyriment](https://github.com/expyriment/expyriment) - Platform-independent lightweight Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and neuroimaging experiments.
- [BindsNET](https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet) - Package for simulating spiking neural networks for reinforcement & machine learning.
- [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface) - Framework designed to unify spike-sorting technologies
- [FieldTrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip) - Toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis.
- [Brayns](https://github.com/BlueBrain/Brayns) - Minimalistic visualiser that can perform ray-traced rendering of neurons. Ray-tracing can help to highlight areas of neural circuits where cells touch each other and where synapses are being created leading to a better understanding of how individual cells and subsequently the brain functions.
- [Brainbrowser](https://github.com/aces/brainbrowser) - Library exposing set of web-based 3D visualization tools primarily targetting neuroimaging.
- [nat: NeuroAnatomy Toolbox](https://github.com/jefferis/nat) - Package for the (3D) visualisation and analysis of biological image data, especially tracings of single neurons.
- [brainGraph](https://github.com/cwatson/brainGraph) - Package for performing graph theory analyses of brain MRI data.
