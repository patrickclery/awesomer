# awesome-malware-persistence

A curated list of awesome malware persistence tools and resources. 

## Collection

- [Awesome Forensics](https://github.com/Cugu/awesome-forensics) - Use the tools from this list which includes awesome free (mostly open source) forensic analysis tools and resources. They help collecting the persistence mechanisms at scale, e.g. by using remote forensics tools.
- [OSSEC](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids) - Use rules and logs from the HIDS to detection configuration changes. _There is no dedicated persistence collection tool for Linux I'm aware of. Use some of the tools from #General or standard OS commands for collection. Thanks for contributing links to Linux specific persistence collection tools._
- [Linux Security and Monitoring Scripts](https://github.com/sqall01/LSMS) - Security and monitoring scripts you can use to monitor your Linux installation for security-related events or for an investigation. Among other finding systemd unit files used for malware persistence.
- [PowerShell Autoruns](https://github.com/p0w3rsh3ll/AutoRuns) - A PowerShell version of Autoruns.
- [PersistenceSniper](https://github.com/last-byte/PersistenceSniper) - Powershell module to hunt for persistence implanted in Windows machines.
- [RegRipper](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper2.8) - Extracts various persistence mechanisms from the registry files directly.
- [RECmd](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RECmd) - Extract various persistence mechanisms, e.g. by using the config file [UserClassesASEPs](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RECmd/blob/master/BatchExamples/UserClassesASEPs.reb) to extract user's CLSID information.

## Detection Testing

- [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) - Atomic Red Team supports also the MITRE ATT&CK persistence techniques, see e.g. [T1044 "File System Permissions Weakness"](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1044/T1044.yaml).
- [PANIX](https://github.com/Aegrah/PANIX) - A highly customizable Linux persistence tool. Perform various persistence techniques against Linux systems, among others Debian and RHEL.
- [Diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) - A loadable kernel module (LKM) rootkit for Linux Kernels (x86/x86_64 and ARM64).
- [PoisonApple](https://github.com/CyborgSecurity/PoisonApple) - Perform various persistence techniques on macOS.
- [hasherezade persistence demos](https://github.com/hasherezade/persistence_demos) - Various (also non standard) persistence methods used by malware for testing own detection, among others COM hijacking demo is found in the repo.

## Persistence Removal

- [Awesome Incident Response](https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-incident-response) - Use the tools and resources for security incident response, aimed to help security analysts and DFIR teams.
- [PowerSponse](https://github.com/swisscom/PowerSponse) - PowerSponse includes various commands for cleanup of persistence mechanisms.

## Techniques

- [forensic artifact repository](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts) - Forensic artifact repository covers persistence techniques in their artifacts.
- [PANIX - Persistence Against *NIX - Features](https://github.com/Aegrah/PANIX) - List of persistence techniques.
- [ebpfkit](https://github.com/Gui774ume/ebpfkit) - Rootkit leveraging eBPF.
- [TripleCross](https://github.com/h3xduck/TripleCross) - Rootkit leveraging eBPF.

## Prevention

- [BlockBlock](https://github.com/objective-see/BlockBlock) - A tool which provides continual protection by monitoring persistence locations and protects them accordingly. Similar to KnockKnock but for blocking.
