ðŸ§« A curated list of resources relevant to doing Biomedical Information Extraction (including BioNLP)

## Datasets

- [CORD-19](https://github.com/allenai/cord19) - A corpus of scholarly manuscripts concerning COVID-19. Articles are primarily from PubMed Central and preprint servers, though the set also includes metadata on papers without full-text availability.
- [CRAFT](https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/CRAFT) - [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-024-0881-2_53) - 67 full-text biomedical articles annotated in a variety of ways, including for concepts and coreferences. Now on version 5, including annotations linking concepts to the MONDO disease ontology.

## Tools, Platforms, and Services

- [DeepPhe](https://github.com/DeepPhe/DeepPhe-Release) - A system for processing documents describing cancer presentations. Based on cTAKES (see above).
- [Pubrunner](https://github.com/jakelever/pubrunner) - A framework for running text mining tools on the newest set(s) of documents from PubMed.
- [SemEHR](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-SemEHR) - [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019046/) - an IE infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR). Built on the [CogStack project](https://github.com/CogStack).
- [TabInOut](https://github.com/nikolamilosevic86/TabInOut) - [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10032-019-00317-0) - a framework for IE from tables in the literature.
