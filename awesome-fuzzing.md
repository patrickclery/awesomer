# awesome-fuzzing

A curated list of awesome Fuzzing(or Fuzz Testing) for software security

## Tools

- [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) - AFL++ is a superior fork to Google's AFL - more speed, more and better mutations, more and better instrumentation, custom module support, etc.
- [Angora](https://github.com/AngoraFuzzer/Angora) - Angora is a mutation-based coverage guided fuzzer. The main goal of Angora is to increase branch coverage by solving path constraints without symbolic execution.
- [CorbFuzz](https://github.com/shouc/corbfuzz) - CorbFuzz is a state-aware fuzzer for generating as much reponses from a web application as possible without need of setting up database, etc.
- [DifuzzRTL](https://github.com/compsec-snu/difuzz-rtl) - DifuzzRTL is a differential fuzz testing approach for CPU verification.
- [FANS](https://github.com/iromise/fans) - FANS is a fuzzing tool for fuzzing Android native system services. It contains four components: interface collector, interface model extractor, dependency inferer, and fuzzer engine.
- [Fluffy](https://github.com/snuspl/fluffy) - Fluffy is a multi-transaction differential fuzzer for finding consensus bugs in Ethereum.
- [GraphFuzz](https://github.com/ForAllSecure/GraphFuzz) - GraphFuzz is an experimental framework for building structure-aware, library API fuzzers.
- [LOKI](https://github.com/ConsensusFuzz/LOKI) - LOKI is a blockchain consensus protocol fuzzing framework that detects the consensus memory related and logic bugs.
- [MINER](https://github.com/puppet-meteor/MINER) - MINER is a REST API fuzzer that utilizes three data-driven designs working together to guide the sequence generation, improve the request generation quality, and capture the unique errors caused by incorrect parameter usage.
- [Minerva](https://github.com/ChijinZ/Minerva) - Minerva is a browser fuzzer augmented by API mod-ref relations, aiming to synthesize highly-relevant browser API invocations in each test case.
- [MorFuzz](https://github.com/sycuricon/MorFuzz) - MorFuzz is a generic RISC-V processor fuzzing framework that can efficiently detect software triggerable functional bugs.
- [RestTestGen](https://github.com/SeUniVr/RestTestGen) - RestTestGen is a robust tool and framework designed for automated black-box testing of RESTful web APIs.
- [SpecFuzz](https://github.com/tudinfse/SpecFuzz) - SpecFuzz is a tool to enable fuzzing for Spectre vulnerabilities
- [Squirrel](https://github.com/s3team/Squirrel) - Squirrel is a fuzzer for database managment systems (DBMSs).
- [TEFuzz](https://github.com/seclab-fudan/TEFuzz) - TEFuzz is a tailored fuzzing-based framework to facilitate the detection and exploitation of template escape bugs.
- [Transynther](https://github.com/vernamlab/Medusa) - Transynther automatically generates and tests building blocks for Meltdown attacks with various faults and microcode assists.
- [Witcher](https://github.com/sefcom/Witcher) - Witcher is a web application fuzzer that utilizes mutational fuzzing to explore web applications and fault escalation to detect command and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
