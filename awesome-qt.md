## Other Relevant Awesome Lists

- [Awesome C/C++](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) - There's no reason you can't use C++ libraries that weren't designed for Qt.  Sometimes they might even suit your needs better than what Qt offers.
- [Awesome C](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c) - Same goes for C libraries; might wanna brush up on those RAII techniques while you're at it.
- [Awesome CMake](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake) - If you're not using qmake for your project, you're likely using CMake instead.
- [Awesome OpenGL](https://github.com/eug/awesome-opengl) - Qt is commonly used for graphics applications, even providing its own wrappers around OpenGL.
